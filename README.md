Application name: On Track!

Purpose of the application: Plan and track your entertainment expense.

**Design Process**

Relying on ionic, I wanted a simple design with simple navigation so I went with ionic tabs. From there on, I added forms on each of the tabs; Entertainment tracking, Wishlist and profile.

Users can track their entertainment extra by entering their expense amounts spent on entertainment such as games, vacations, tv programes etc.
